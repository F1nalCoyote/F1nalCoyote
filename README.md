- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @F1nalCoyote - or Colin!
- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in open-source software development in healthcare; specifically healthcare sim but other areas too.
-    I might fork your repo - I'm looking at a lot of projects to help me learn!
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning a lot!
-     I used to develop on VB and C++ back in the day - nowadays I'm scratching up on a lot of new developments in software and trying to learn some new tricks!

- ðŸ“« You can reach me here at GitHub if you have any questions!
